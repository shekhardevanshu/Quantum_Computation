This is the beginning of my quantum computation journey. I wrote code in Python to simulate the three key steps in quantum computation: Initialization, evolution (gates), and measurement, without using external libraries. After successfully writing the codes for these basic operations, I simulated Shor's Algorithm and Wheeler's delayed choice experiment using the developed functionalities. This gave me a more fundamental understanding of what goes behind a quantum computing protocol.
